        <h2>Intro</h2><hr>
        <p>Hi, I'm Vincent. If you're interested in recording your music or having a song created, then you're in the right place. I have experience writing and recording songs as a solo artist and with my band 'Tenmoku' as the lead singer and drummer. Here in my home studio I enjoy producing music in collaboration with others and encouraging other artists with their own music projects.

        <p id="review">Previous client's review:</p>
        <div>
            <p>"We commissioned Vince to write a song as a present for my daughter’s 18th birthday. We wrote some funny memories and listed our daughter’s favourite songs, and after meeting with Vince to discuss these, he then wrote a brilliant, sweet, emotional, funny song that exactly hit the brief.</p>
            <p>On top of this, he coached each member of the family to sing their verse, and helped us to perform – all in the comfort of his lovely studio. He had to work very hard to get a decent recording from us, but he persevered with patience and understanding.</p>
            <p>He then mixed all of these tracks into the master song, adding various instruments and effects. It really does sound great (apart from our terrible singing!).</p>
            <p>It was a pleasure working with him and I’d really recommend him, and his studio, to anybody."</p></div>
